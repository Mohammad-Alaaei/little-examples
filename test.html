While our commitment was missed for a second time in a row, a colleague introduced me to Ray and his team. After the first meeting, we had a plan to not only come back on track and set our new timeline to serve our clients, but also he introduced us to a process management platform that empowered us to stay on time for all future set of activities. It is more than a year that we are using their services and their SaaS services in a form of a framework to manage our day-to-day tasks. I’d definitely recommend Ultima’s team to anyone that might have a need for workflow management in a very tensive customer and client management space. Their effective and practical solutions has stretched my wallet, but was worth every penny.",
